# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

<!-- Pro portfolio README -->

# professional-portfolio
My professional portfolio for employment and project opportunities.

# joe-higgs-portfolio
This is my professional portfolio that communicates my experience, skill and expertise in Web Development for future roles and my career. 

## Description 
The goal of this project is to deliver a high-quality one-page website for myself, Joe Higgs. The intention is to promote myself to potential clients and employers in order to secure employment. As I continue to grow and develop within this field, I will continue to update it and demonstrate my skills through projects that I will add to the portfolio. The priority was to ensure effective use of html and css elements to construct a page which functions as intended. By applying my skills in these fields, I have been able to fully construct the page without any functionality issues. I have also taken time to extensively comment the .html and .css files so my work is understood.

## Credits

The project was completed independently but built off the source code from edX Boot Camps LLC. I worked with my tutor, Mila Hose, to identify issues and format my code effectively. We also discussed how effective use of flexboxes has made my work more efficient.

In producing this webpage, I utilized a range of tutorials from W3 Schools and referred to several posts on Stack Overflow.
